To uninstall a package you have previously installed locally (using npm install <package-name> in the node_modules folder, run npm uninstall <package-name>

npm uninstall bootstrap

removed 2 packages, and audited 1 package in 335ms

found 0 vulnerabilities


from the project root folder (the folder that contains the node_modules folder).

Using the -S flag, or --save, this operation will also remove the reference in the package.json file.


package.json will be automatically updated with devDependency and dependency once you uninstall npm package.

If the package is installed globally, you need to add the -g / --global flag:

npm uninstall -g <package-name>

and you can run this command from anywhere you want on your system because the folder where you currently are does not matter.
