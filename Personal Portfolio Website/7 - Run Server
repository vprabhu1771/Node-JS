### Running the Project

1. **Start the Server**:
   Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

2. **Access the Website**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your portfolio website.

### Notes:

- **Email Configuration**: Replace `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` in the `.env` file with your email credentials. Ensure that your email provider allows less secure apps or uses application-specific passwords if needed.
- **Security**: For production use, never store sensitive information in your source code. Use environment variables securely.
- **Extensions**: Add more sections to your portfolio (e.g., About, Projects, Skills) to expand it. You can also integrate a database to store messages instead of sending them via email.
