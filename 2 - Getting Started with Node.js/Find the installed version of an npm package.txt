To see the version of all installed npm packages, including their dependencies:

npm list


node_project@1.0.0 /Users/prabhu/Desktop/node_project
└── bootstrap@5.1.0

You can also just open the package-lock.json file, but this involves some visual scanning.

npm list -g is the same, but for globally installed packages.

npm list -g

/usr/local/lib
└── npm@7.20.6


To get only your top-level packages (basically, the ones you told npm to install and you listed in the package.json), run npm list --depth=0:

npm list --depth=0

node_project@1.0.0 /Users/prabhu/Desktop/node_project
└── bootstrap@5.1.0


You can get the version of a specific package by specifying its name:

npm list bootstrap

node_project@1.0.0 /Users/prabhu/Desktop/node_project
└── bootstrap@5.1.0




if you want to see what's the latest available version of the package on the npm repository, run npm view [package_name] version:

npm view bootstrap version
5.1.0
